 run a music studio where people come to record their songs. I need a system that helps me keep track of who came in, when they came, how long they recorded, and how long I spent mixing their tracks afterward. I want this to be organized and easy to use, so I can focus on the creative side without losing track of the logistics.
Hereâ€™s what I need:
1. Clients
Basic info about each person who records at my studio.
- client_id: unique ID
- name: full name
- contact_info: phone or email
- date: session date
- start_time and end_time: when recording started and ended
- recording_duration: calculated from start/end
- notes: anything I want to jot down

ðŸ“Š Reports I Want Weekly
- Total time spent recording this week
- Total time spent mixing this week
- Number of sessions this week
- Average session length
